    <h1>Spaghetti Carbonara</h1>

    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a traditional Roman pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper. It's rich, creamy (without cream!), and incredibly satisfying.</p> <!-- Description -->

    <p>Carbonara is known for its simple ingredients and bold flavor. Cooked pasta is tossed with a sauce made from eggs and cheese, which gently cooks with the heat of the pasta. Crispy pancetta or guanciale adds a salty, savory depth, while freshly ground black pepper gives it a spicy finish.</p>

    <p>The key is timing—mixing everything quickly while the pasta is hot, so the eggs form a silky sauce rather than scrambling. No cream is needed, just a perfect balance of cheese, fat, and heat. Serve immediately for the best texture and flavor.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <p><strong>For the dish:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti – 400g (14 oz)</li>
        <li>Pancetta or guanciale – 150g (5 oz), diced</li>
        <li>Eggs – 4 large (2 whole eggs, 2 yolks)</li>
        <li>Grated Pecorino Romano – 1 cup (about 100g)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper – 1 teaspoon (or to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt – for pasta water</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>In a skillet over medium heat, cook pancetta or guanciale until crisp. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, grated Pecorino Romano, and black pepper until smooth.</li>
        <li>Immediately after draining the pasta, return it to the pot or a large mixing bowl while still hot.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked pancetta and mix well.</li>
        <li>Quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, tossing vigorously to coat the pasta and create a creamy sauce. Add a little reserved pasta water as needed to adjust the consistency.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with extra cheese and black pepper on top.</li>
    </ol>
