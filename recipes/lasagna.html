    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of flat pasta, meat or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta, and melted cheese, all baked untli golden and bubbly.</p> <!-- Description -->

    <p>Lasagna is made by layering cooked flat pasta sheets with a rich filling, usually a meat-based tomato sauce or a vegetarian alternative like spinach and mushrooms. A creamy layer, either béchamel sauce or a ricotta cheese mixture, is added between the layers to provide moisture and depth of flavor. Grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese are sprinkled throughout to add richness and create a golden, bubbly top when baked.</p>

    <p>To prepare it, the sauce is simmered until thick and flavorful, while the pasta is either boiled or prepared from no-boil sheets. In a baking dish, the ingredients are layered—starting with sauce, followed by pasta, cheese, and cream—repeating the layers until the dish is full. The lasagna is then baked in the oven until hot throughout and the top is lightly browned. After resting briefly to set, it’s sliced and served warm.</p>

    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion and garlic, sauté until soft and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, and red wine (if using). Simmer the sauce on low for about 20-30 minutes until thickened.</li>
        <li>While the sauce simmers, cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions if using regular noodles. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese, egg, grated Parmesan, salt, and optional spinach until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce to cover the bottom.</li>
        <li>Layer noodles over the sauce, then spread a layer of the ricotta mixture, followed by meat sauce and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella. Repeat the layers until ingredients are used up, finishing with sauce and mozzarella on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle extra Parmesan cheese on the top layer.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25-30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving to help it set.</li>
