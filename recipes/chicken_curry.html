    <p>Chicken curry is a flavorful and aromatic dish made with tender chicken pieces simmered in a spiced tomato-onion gravy, often enriched with yogurt or cream and served with rice or flatbread.</p> <!-- Description -->

    <p>This dish is known for its rich blend of spices, including turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The chicken is typically marinated for added flavor and cooked slowly to absorb the sauce. Regional variations exist across South Asia, each with its unique twist on ingredients and spice levels.</p>

    <p>To make chicken curry, the base sauce is built by sautéing onions, garlic, and ginger, then adding tomatoes and spices. The chicken is added and cooked until tender, with yogurt or cream stirred in toward the end for creaminess. It’s a comforting, satisfying meal best enjoyed hot with naan or steamed rice.</p>
