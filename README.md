# odin-recipes

This is my first HTML project. It includes simple recipe pages for dishes like Lasagna, Spaghetti Carbonara, and Chicken Curry. I learned how to use basic HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and how to organize content using unordered and ordered lists. Each page has a picture of the dish, a short description, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions. I also added a link to go back to the homepage. This project helped me understand the structure of a basic webpage.
